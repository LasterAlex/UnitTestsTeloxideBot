If you are planning on contributing - thanks in advance, i really hope this repo will be useful to you and other programmers!

I do not expect a lot of activity in this repo, as it is only an example, but if you want to add something (for example, a `TestingInterceptAndReturnMessage` implementation, or some new features), i will try to merge them if they are good
There aren't strict guidelines, the repo is too small for it, just

1) Make code that works
2) Comment the code (so there isn't any dark magic in the code, i want this repo to be accessible to not very experienced rust devs)
3) Make so it doesn't look too bad
